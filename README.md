# hello-world
This is my first repository.
I am currently working towards my Master's in Cyber Security. 
I picked up coding a few years ago, to expand on what I learned in school, and I fell in love with it.
Primarily, I use python, however, I have a little experience with some other languages, for example C, perl, php, due to my research.
